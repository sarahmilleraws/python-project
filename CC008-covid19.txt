Assignment - 007/2 (Covid-19)
Problem :
•	Task : Estimating the risk of death from coronavirus. Write a program that;
•	Takes "Yes" or "No" from the user as an answer to the following questions :
o	Are you a cigarette addict older than 75 years old? Variable → age
o	Do you have a severe chronic disease? Variable → chronic
o	Is your immune system too weak? Variable → immune
Set a logical algorithm using boolean logic operators (and/or) and use if-statements with the given variables in order to print out us a message : "You are in risky group"(if True ) or "You are not in risky group" (if False).
Answer:
Input:
#age  #a sigarette addict older than 75
#chronic   #have a chronic disease
#immune  #immune system to weak
# risk: There is a risk of death because of covid-19

age = int(input("Enter your age, please: "))
chronic = input("Are you have a chronic disease? Please answer: Yes/No :")
immune = input("Is your immune system weak? Please answer: Yes/No :")

if age > 75: 
  #print("Your age is upper than 75.")
  if (chronic == "Yes") and (immune == "Yes"):
    print("You are high risk of death because of covid-19.")
  elif (chronic == "Yes") and (immune == "No"):
    print("You are a risk of death because of covid-19.")
  elif (chronic == "No") and (immune == "Yes"):
    print("You are a risk of death because of covid-19.")
  else:
    print("You are a low risk of death because of covid-19.")

elif age < 75:
  #print("Your age is lower than 75.")
  if (chronic == "Yes") and (immune == "Yes"):
    print("You are a risk of death because of covid-19.")
  elif (chronic == "No") and (immune == "Yes"):
    print("You are a low risk of death because of covid-19.")
  else:
    print("You are not a risk of death because of covid-19.")

else:
    print("You are not a risk of death because of covid-19.")

Output:
Enter your age, please: 16
Are you have a chronic disease? Please answer: Yes/No :No
Is your immune system weak? Please answer: Yes/No :No
You are not a risk of death because of covid-19.
